## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in ARRIS router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `setup.cgi` binary:

In the router's `ntp` function, `TimeZone` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `TimeZone` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked.And then,call the function `scnvram_set` to store this input.

In `rc` binary:

As you can see here, in `sub_1666C` function, the initial input has not checked and cause command injection.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.

## PoC

We set `TimeZone` as **%60%2Fusr%2Fsbin%2Freboot%60** , The meaning of this command is **`/usr/sbin/reboot`**，and the router will excute it,such as:
