Type:Remote Command Execution



## Vulnerability description

We found an Command Injection vulnerability  in ARRIS router with firmware which was released recently, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands from a crafted request.

**Remote Command Execution**

In `setup.cgi` binary:

In the router's `traceroute ` function, `TracerouteHost` is directly passed by the attacker, so we can control the `TracerouteHost` to attack the OS.

As you can see here, the input has not been checked.And then,call the function `scnvram_set` to store this input.

As you can see here, in `sub_1DE34` function, the initial input has not checked and cause command injection.

**Supplement**

In order to avoid such problems, we believe that the string content should be checked in the input extraction part.What’s more interesting is that in the front-end interface, the user’s input is not checked either.

## PoC

We set `TracerouteHost` as **`%3B%2Fusr%2Fsbin%2Fps%3E.%2Fhack.txt%3B`** , The meaning of this command is **;/usr/sbin/ps>./hack.txt;**，and the router will excute it,such as:
